# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the comprehensive approach for deploying the FisioFlow mobile application to the Apple App Store. The solution encompasses app store optimization, compliance with Apple guidelines, automated build/deployment processes, and quality assurance workflows. The design leverages the existing Expo/React Native infrastructure while implementing production-ready enhancements.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Build Configuration System

**EAS Build Profiles**
- **Production Profile**: Optimized builds for App Store submission
- **Preview Profile**: Internal testing builds for TestFlight
- **Development Profile**: Development and debugging builds

**Configuration Files:**
- `eas.json`: Build and submission configuration
- `app.json`: App metadata and iOS-specific settings
- `app.config.js`: Dynamic configuration management

### 2. App Store Metadata Management

**App Store Connect Integration**
- App information and descriptions
- Screenshots and preview videos
- Pricing and availability settings
- Review information and notes

**Localization Support**
- Portuguese (Brazil) as primary language
- Localized app descriptions and keywords
- Localized screenshots and metadata

### 3. Compliance and Privacy System

**Privacy Policy Integration**
- LGPD compliance for Brazilian users
- Apple privacy requirements
- Data collection transparency
- User consent management

**Permissions Management**
- Camera access for exercise documentation
- Photo library access for image attachments
- Background processing for notifications
- Proper usage descriptions in Info.plist

### 4. Quality Assurance Framework

**Automated Testing Pipeline**
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for iOS devices

**Device Testing Matrix**
- iPhone models (12, 13, 14, 15 series)
- iPad support (if applicable)
- iOS version compatibility (iOS 14+)
- Different screen sizes and orientations

## Data Models

### App Store Metadata Model

```typescript
interface AppStoreMetadata {
  appName: string;
  subtitle: string;
  description: string;
  keywords: string[];
  category: AppStoreCategory;
  contentRating: ContentRating;
  screenshots: Screenshot[];
  previewVideos: PreviewVideo[];
  appIcon: AppIcon;
  version: string;
  buildNumber: string;
  releaseNotes: string;
  reviewNotes: string;
  localizations: Localization[];
}

interface Screenshot {
  deviceType: DeviceType;
  imageUrl: string;
  displayOrder: number;
  localization: string;
}

interface Localization {
  language: string;
  appName: string;
  subtitle: string;
  description: string;
  keywords: string[];
  releaseNotes: string;
}
```

### Build Configuration Model

```typescript
interface BuildConfiguration {
  platform: 'ios';
  profile: 'production' | 'preview' | 'development';
  bundleIdentifier: string;
  version: string;
  buildNumber: string;
  distribution: 'store' | 'internal';
  codeSigningIdentity: string;
  provisioningProfile: string;
  entitlements: Entitlements;
}

interface Entitlements {
  backgroundModes: string[];
  cameraUsage: boolean;
  photoLibraryUsage: boolean;
  pushNotifications: boolean;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Build Process Error Handling

**Build Failures**
- Automatic retry mechanism for transient failures
- Detailed error logging and reporting
- Fallback to previous successful build configuration
- Developer notification system for critical failures

**Submission Errors**
- App Store Connect API error handling
- Metadata validation error recovery
- Binary upload failure recovery
- Review rejection handling workflow

### Runtime Error Handling

**App Store Review Preparation**
- Crash reporting integration (Sentry/Bugsnag)
- Performance monitoring setup
- Error boundary implementation
- Graceful degradation for network issues

**User Experience Protection**
- Offline functionality for core features
- Loading states and error messages
- Data persistence during app updates
- Smooth onboarding experience

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-submission Testing

**Automated Test Suite**
1. **Unit Tests**: Core business logic validation
2. **Integration Tests**: API and service integration
3. **Component Tests**: UI component functionality
4. **E2E Tests**: Critical user journey validation

**Manual Testing Checklist**
1. **Device Compatibility**: Test on multiple iOS devices
2. **Performance Testing**: App launch time, memory usage
3. **Accessibility Testing**: VoiceOver and accessibility features
4. **Localization Testing**: Portuguese language support
5. **Privacy Compliance**: Data handling and permissions

### TestFlight Beta Testing

**Internal Testing Phase**
